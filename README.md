Auction Zone is a dynamic, web-based auction platform where users can list items for auction and bid on others' listings. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a rich, interactive user experience for auction participants, with a focus on simplicity and functionality.

## Description

Auction Zone caters to users with stud.noroff.no emails, facilitating a community where members can easily sell and purchase items using a credit-based system. Features and functionalities include:

- **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and logout capabilities.
- **Profile Customization:** Ability for users to update their avatars.
- **Credit Management:** Users can view their credit balance, which is affected by auction activities.
- **Listing and Bidding:** Users can create listings for auction and place bids on active listings.

### Missing Functionalities

While Auction Zone is operational with the core functionalities, several intended features are currently missing or incomplete:

- **Credit System Enhancements:** The process for earning and spending credits through auction activities needs further development.
- **Comprehensive Search Filters:** Enhanced search functionality for unregistered users is planned but not yet implemented.
- **Real-time Auction Updates:** Live updates for bids and listing statuses are in the roadmap.
- **User Dashboard Improvements:** Enhancements to display personalized auction activities and histories are pending.
